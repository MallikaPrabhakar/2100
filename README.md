## Game: 2100

### Description
Observing the rise in COVID-19 cases all over the globe, we wanted to create a game which would be a dystopian fiction of a world in an unrestrained strong virus growth.

### How to Play?
1. **2100** is a two player game which uses one of the device as the server, hence you will need two devices on the same local network or the public IP address for one of the device (via port forwarding).
2. Make sure you have the basic `SDL2` library along with `SDL2_ttf`, `SDL2_mixer` and `SDL2_image` libraries.
3. To install the above libraries you can run the following command (on Linux)

```sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0```

4. Once you have the required dependencies, clone this repo and run the following command

```cd src && make install```

5. If the installation is successful, you can run the game using the command

```./game```

6. You can also create an application menu entry by [following this](https://medium.com/@mononz/custom-launcher-for-run-installs-on-ubuntu-debian-660bd09218bd) (optional)
