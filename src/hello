1. First page --> intro --> player --> main menu (branche into sub menu) -->game --> result/exit

2. Currently, mode is local var

3. first page and intro are distinct and away from rest of flow

4. exit can be prettier

5. FLAWS:
    
    5.2 the flow mentioned in point 1 is not smooth
    5.3 exit is not good enough
